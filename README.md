My blog, which has a title but doesn't like titles.

I made this Jekyll theme by adapting and modifying the [Cayman Blog](https://github.com/adueck/cayman-blog) Jekyll Theme by Adam Dueck, which is adapted and modified from the [Cayman Theme](https://github.com/jasonlong/cayman-theme) by [Jason Lang](https://github.com/jasonlong), which is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
