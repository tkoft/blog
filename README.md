My blog, which has a title but doesn't like titles.

Please ignore the thousands of meaningless commits this will have; I find running a Jekyll blog with gh-pages is inherently problematic since you want to be able to easily make posts, but to publish anything you have to commit to Git which isn't really what Git commits are for (although I'm not the most diligent with that anyway...).

I made this Jekyll theme by adapting and modifying the [Cayman Blog](https://github.com/adueck/cayman-blog) Jekyll Theme by Adam Dueck, which is adapted and modified from the [Cayman Theme](https://github.com/jasonlong/cayman-theme) by [Jason Lang](https://github.com/jasonlong), which is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
