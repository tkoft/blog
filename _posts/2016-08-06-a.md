As a Computer Science major at a liberal arts school, I've so far entered the art world with **MUS175 Sound Art and Public Music**; I've experienced the thrill of the theater with **THEA244 Introduction to Theater Technology**; I've entered the minds of great thinkers in **PHIL126 Paradoxes**; I've learned to tell stories and weave together compelling audio narrative in **ENGL213 Making Radio**; I've even learned more about my savior Jesus's message on earth and undestood a new side of God's nature with the help of **REL204 The Kingdom of God and Social Change**.  Oh, and I did some **MUS281 Jazz Drumming**.
