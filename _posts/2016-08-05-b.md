Programmer jokes get old pretty fast, but [Classic Programmer Paintings](http://classicprogrammerpaintings.com/) absolutely never fail to please me.  Here's a random one:

 <div> 
    <object id="cpp" type="text/html" data="http://classicprogrammerpaintings.com/random" width="100%" height="400px">
    </object>
 </div>

 I have a feeling that framing other websites like this is bad etiquette.  I know it used to be a security vulnerability (for the other site, that is), but that shouldn't be true anymore.  But Jekyll strips any JavaScript from blog posts, so I can't really do anything too exciting here.

 On another note, it seems like randomizing things on page load is [becoming](https://wso.williams.edu/) [quite](http://www.arg.press/) [trendy](http://www.grchen.com/).  This is something I hope doesn't become cliche in a few years.
